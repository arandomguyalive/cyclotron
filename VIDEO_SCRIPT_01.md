## 📜 The Script

### **0:00 - 0:25: The Problem (The "Status Quo")**
*   **Visual:** POV walking at night (street lights reflecting) or sitting in a very dark room with just monitor glow.
*   **Action:** Holding the phone, screen off (black).
*   **Audio (Voiceover):** "You think you're the customer. But on your current app... you're the product. They track your gaze. They sell your location. They read your DMs."
*   **Audio (SFX):** *City noise / Low drone.*

### **0:25 - 0:45: The Solution (The Glimpse)**
*   **Visual:** Tap the screen. The **ABHED** logo flashes (glitch effect).
*   **Audio (Voiceover):** "We built something different. A Digital Fortress."
*   **Action:** Unlock the phone.
    *   *Cut 1:* Extreme close-up of the **Vortex** spinning (abstract colors).
    *   *Cut 2:* A finger hitting the **"Ghost Mode"** toggle.
    *   *Cut 3:* The "Encrypted" lock icon glowing green.
*   **Audio (Voiceover):** "No tracking. No algorithm. No data harvesting."

### **0:45 - 1:10: The Difference (The "Physics")**
*   **Visual:** Show the phone tilted at an angle, obscuring the text but showing the **3D depth** of the UI.
*   **Audio (Voiceover):** "It doesn't behave like a normal app. It fights back. If you're Free tier? You get interference. If you're Sovereign? You're a ghost."
*   **Action:** Show a "Signal Interference" glitch effect (if available) or just the clean Sovereign interface.
*   **Text Overlay:** `TIER 5 // SOVEREIGN`

### **1:10 - 1:30: The Call to Action**
*   **Visual:** The screen shows "System Secure" or the Profile badge.
*   **Audio (Voiceover):** "Privacy isn't a setting anymore. It's a luxury. Welcome to Abhed."
*   **Action:** Turn off the screen. Darkness.
*   **Text Overlay:** `ABHED.APP // SECURE YOUR ID`
*   **Audio:** *Heavy door slam sound (Reverb).*

## 🎥 Filming Tips for "Mystery"
*   **Angles:** Don't film the screen flat-on. Film from the side or bottom to show the "glow" without revealing readable text.
*   **Focus:** Rack focus (go from blurry to sharp) on specific icons like the "Lock" or "Ghost".
*   **Reflections:** Use the reflection of the screen in a window or glasses for a "cyberpunk" shot.
